Repository of my Codeforces solutions over the course of the last year.

My profile: https://codeforces.com/profile/dzng

My current project is to solve a minimum of one problem per day for a year -- I am currently at 220 days and counting! This repository contains all of my confirmed solutions to various Codeforces problems, sorted by contest ID and problem number.

A folder numbered with number x contains problems from the contest with ID x to the contest with ID x + 99, as defined by the URL for that problem -- contest 122 problem A is found at https://codeforces.com/contest/122A, for example.

I've solved over 270 problems to date.

Favourite problems:

* Ehab the Xorcist (https://codeforces.com/contest/1325/problem/D)
* Uncle Bogdan and Country Happiness (https://codeforces.com/contest/1388/problem/C)
* 13th Labour of Heracles (https://codeforces.com/contest/1466/problem/D)
